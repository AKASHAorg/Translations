## Agenda
We use the structure of [Scrum Meetings](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum) as a general reference for our own meetings, i.e. each person *can* use the three following questions to guide its own agenda. 

1. What did you do yesterday?
1. What will you do today?
1. Are there any impediments in your way?
